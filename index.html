The past two months that you put your hapyness second and put up with me, where patient with me when I was at my most vulnerable, it's something..... it's something that I tought no one would ever do for me.

                    <p>Sometimes when I am restless I project one simple image into my head. Us standing in bed, our bodies glued to eachother with our closed and simply hodling each other in our arms. These image, the peace that it brings has guided me trough my most stressful and dark times, in my dark days it is one of the few things that calms me. Thank you for being the light in my dark</p>

I appreciate you being honest with me even tough my reaction is not so pleasent(understatement of the year).

When we were talking about values and what values changed when you got there I was really impressed that you adopted this, you have my admiration and respect for it. Also cand mi-ai spus despre faza cu sarutul a part of me was really grateful that you told me and were transparent.</p>

I always feel that I am listned to and this is one of the reasons that makes me come back for more and more talking.</p>
